# Language Translation NLLB-200 Web Interface
## About
This project hosts a Streamlit [web application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/isaacnicolas/demo-nllb) that provides fast and accurate language translation services. It harnesses the power of the NLLB-200 (No Language Left Behind) model, one of the most advanced multilingual translation models available, and employs CTranslate2 for efficient CPU-based inference. The app aims to deliver a user-friendly translation experience, making it easier to break down language barriers in global communication.

- **Efficient Translation**: Utilizes CTranslate2, an optimized inference engine for Transformer models, ensuring quick and reliable translation on CPU architectures.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers an intuitive and responsive interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be accessible and easy to use, requiring no technical expertise from the user.
